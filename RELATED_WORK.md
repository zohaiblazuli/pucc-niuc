## Industry Security Frameworks

The cybersecurity industry has recognized the growing threat of AI-powered attacks and prompt injection vulnerabilities through several authoritative frameworks and guidance documents. The **OWASP AI Security and Privacy Guide** [@owasp_ai_guide2024] emphasizes "defense in depth" approaches for LLM applications, identifying prompt injection as a critical vulnerability where "attackers can manipulate model behavior through crafted inputs designed to override original instructions." The OWASP LLM Top 10 framework classifies prompt injection as LLM01, the highest-priority risk, noting that these attacks "can cause the LLM to ignore previous instructions or perform unintended actions" [@owasp_llm_2024].

However, OWASP's recommended mitigations focus primarily on input validation, output sanitization, and user privilege restrictions—approaches that operate reactively rather than providing formal guarantees about security properties. The guidance acknowledges that "complete prevention may not be feasible" due to the inherent complexity of natural language processing and the difficulty of distinguishing legitimate instructions from malicious ones.

**NIST's AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)** [@nist_ai_rmf2023] provides foundational principles for AI system security, emphasizing the need for "measurable" and "repeatable" testing methodologies. The framework calls for risk assessment procedures that can "identify, estimate, and prioritize" AI-specific risks, including adversarial attacks and data poisoning. NIST's approach focuses on governance structures and risk management processes rather than specific technical countermeasures, highlighting the gap between policy frameworks and executable security controls.

**Microsoft's Responsible AI guidelines** address AI application security through their "AI Security Risk Assessment" framework [@microsoft_ai_security2024], which emphasizes input validation, content filtering, and monitoring systems. Microsoft's approach includes recommendations for "prompt engineering safeguards" and "output validation checks," but these remain primarily detection-based systems that cannot provide mathematical guarantees about security properties. Their guidance on indirect prompt injection specifically notes the challenge of "distinguishing between legitimate user instructions and malicious embedded commands," acknowledging the fundamental limitation of content-based filtering approaches.

## Policy Classifiers and Guard Systems

Current industry practice employs **policy classifiers** and **guard systems** that attempt to identify malicious content through machine learning models trained on examples of prompt injection attacks. Systems like **Meta's Llama Guard** [@meta_llamaguard2024] and **Anthropic's Constitutional AI** [@anthropic_constitutional2024] implement safety classifiers that assign risk scores to inputs and outputs, blocking content that exceeds predefined thresholds.

These approaches suffer from several fundamental limitations. First, they operate **probabilistically**, meaning they inevitably produce false positives (blocking legitimate content) and false negatives (allowing malicious content). Second, they require **extensive training data** covering all possible attack vectors, making them vulnerable to novel evasion techniques not seen during training. Third, they provide **no mathematical guarantees** about their security properties, making it impossible to reason formally about their effectiveness or compose them securely in distributed systems.

**Content filtering systems** employed by major LLM providers (OpenAI's moderation API, Azure Content Safety, Google's Perspective API) focus on detecting harmful content categories (violence, harassment, hate speech) rather than specifically addressing prompt injection attacks. While these systems demonstrate sophisticated natural language understanding capabilities, they are designed for content policy enforcement rather than security property verification, and their proprietary nature prevents independent verification of their security claims.

**Jailbreaking research** [@zou_jailbreaking2023] has demonstrated systematic methods for bypassing existing safety mechanisms through adversarial prompt engineering, role-playing scenarios, and encoding-based evasion techniques. This work highlights the arms race nature of detection-based approaches, where new attack techniques require constant updates to detection models, creating a reactive security posture rather than proactive protection.

## Formal Methods and Proof-Carrying Code

Our work builds upon the foundational concept of **Proof-Carrying Code (PCC)** introduced by Necula and Lee [@necula_lee_1996], where mobile code includes mathematical proofs of its safety properties, enabling verification without trusting the code producer. PCC provided a paradigm shift from "trust the source" to "verify the proof," enabling secure code execution across administrative boundaries.

**Recent formal verification research** has explored applying mathematical proof techniques to neural network security [@wang_formal_verification2021], adversarial robustness certification [@zhang_certified_defense2022], and input validation [@li_input_validation2023]. However, these approaches focus primarily on model robustness rather than application-level security properties, and they have not addressed the specific challenges of indirect prompt injection in production LLM deployments.

**Runtime verification systems** [@falcone_runtime_verification2018] provide frameworks for monitoring system behavior against formal specifications during execution. While these systems offer mathematical rigor for property checking, existing work has not been adapted to handle the unique challenges of LLM applications, particularly the need for character-level provenance tracking and Unicode attack resistance.

## Content Integrity and Provenance Systems

**Digital provenance research** [@moreau_provenance2011] has developed frameworks for tracking data lineage and establishing trust in computational workflows. Systems like PROV-O [@lebo_prov2013] provide ontologies for representing provenance information, while blockchain-based approaches [@zhang_blockchain_provenance2019] offer immutable provenance records. However, existing provenance systems operate at coarse granularities (files, datasets, or computation steps) rather than the character-level precision required for prompt injection defense.

**Information flow control systems** [@sabelfeld_information_flow2003] provide formal methods for tracking how information propagates through computational systems, preventing unauthorized disclosure or modification. While these systems offer theoretical foundations for reasoning about trust boundaries, they have not been adapted to handle the linguistic complexity and real-time processing requirements of LLM applications.

## Novelty and Distinguishing Features

Our NIUC framework differs fundamentally from existing approaches in several key dimensions. First, we provide **per-response cryptographic certificates** that mathematically attest to the security properties of individual LLM outputs, enabling trust composition across organizational boundaries—a capability absent from existing policy classifiers. Second, our approach is **model-agnostic**, operating independently of specific LLM architectures or training procedures, unlike safety classifiers that must be retrained for different models.

Third, NIUC provides **deterministic enforcement** rather than probabilistic detection, ensuring that the same input always produces the same security decision and enabling formal verification of system properties. Fourth, our **character-level provenance tracking** provides precision unmatched by existing systems, enabling detection of sophisticated Unicode-based evasion techniques that bypass traditional content filters.

Finally, our **certified-rewrite capability** represents a novel approach to balancing security and utility, allowing systems to neutralize malicious content while preserving legitimate functionality—a capability not present in existing binary allow/deny systems. This approach enables deployment in production environments where complete blocking of suspicious content would severely degrade user experience.

The combination of formal mathematical guarantees, character-level precision, model-agnostic design, and utility-preserving neutralization distinguishes NIUC from existing detection-based approaches and provides a foundation for trustworthy LLM deployment in privacy-preserving computation environments.
