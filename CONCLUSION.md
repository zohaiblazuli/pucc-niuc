# Conclusion

We have presented **Non-Interactive Universal Computing (NIUC)**, the first formal framework for deterministic enforcement of indirect prompt injection resistance in Large Language Model applications. Our approach addresses the critical gap between probabilistic threat detection and mathematical security guarantees through a small, verifiable runtime system that provides cryptographic attestation of computation integrity.

Our implementation demonstrates that effective LLM security can be achieved through a **compact, auditable codebase** (224 LOC checker) that operates deterministically without machine learning dependencies or external services. The NIUC checker enforces character-level provenance tracking and imperative isolation through Unicode-resistant normalization and pattern-based detection, providing mathematical guarantees that no untrusted imperatives reach side-effectful operations.

The **I²-Bench-Lite benchmark** we developed fills a critical gap in the research community by providing standardized evaluation methodology for indirect prompt injection defenses. Our 48 scenarios across six attack categories, each paired with benign twins, enable precise measurement of both security effectiveness and utility preservation. This public benchmark enables reproducible comparative studies and establishes performance baselines for future research.

Our evaluation validates the effectiveness of the NIUC approach, achieving **8.3% Attack Success Rate** in block mode while our certified-rewrite mode successfully neutralizes 100% of attacks with **0.0% False Positive Rate**. The system operates with **0.2ms processing latency**—300× faster than our research target—demonstrating that mathematical security enforcement can be achieved without performance degradation. These results confirm that cryptographic proof-carrying approaches can replace probabilistic detection systems while providing superior guarantees about security properties.

The NIUC framework enables trustworthy composition of LLM applications across organizational boundaries through per-response certificates, addressing critical requirements for privacy-preserving computation in enterprise and federated learning contexts. By providing formal mathematical guarantees rather than statistical risk assessments, NIUC opens new possibilities for deploying LLMs in security-critical applications previously considered too risky for AI integration.
