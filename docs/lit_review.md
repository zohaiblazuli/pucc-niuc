## Threats → Mitigations → Gaps Analysis

The current landscape of Large Language Model (LLM) security reveals a critical gap between threat detection and enforcement mechanisms, particularly for indirect prompt injection attacks. Current research demonstrates that attackers can manipulate AI systems through carefully crafted inputs that bypass traditional security filters, leading to unauthorized actions, data leakage, or system compromise.

**Emerging Threats**: The sophistication of AI-powered attacks has increased dramatically, with threat actors leveraging deepfake technology, automated reconnaissance, and indirect prompt injection to circumvent existing security measures. Research shows that 45% of organizations are expected to face supply chain attacks by 2025, while AI-enhanced insider threats enable stealthier credential-based attacks. Prompt injection specifically exploits the inherent trust that LLM applications place in user inputs, allowing malicious actors to override system instructions or extract sensitive information.

**Current Mitigations**: Existing mitigation strategies focus primarily on input validation, output filtering, and behavioral monitoring. Organizations are implementing AI-driven defense mechanisms, multi-factor authentication systems, and comprehensive security awareness training. Technical approaches include robust input sanitization, regular AI system audits, and the deployment of guardrail systems like content filters and safety classifiers. However, these approaches predominantly operate as detection systems rather than preventive enforcement mechanisms.

**Critical Gaps**: The fundamental limitation in current approaches is the reliance on post-hoc detection rather than proof-carrying enforcement. Traditional mitigation strategies cannot provide cryptographic guarantees about computation integrity or prevent malicious inputs from reaching the AI system. There is no mechanism to ensure that approved computations include verifiable certificates of compliance, nor systems that can re-verify safety claims after code transformations. This gap is particularly critical for privacy-preserving computation where trust boundaries must be cryptographically enforced rather than merely monitored. The challenge lies in developing systems that combine real-time threat detection with proof-carrying certificates that can demonstrate computational integrity and safety compliance throughout the execution pipeline.

## Research Methodology Notes

This literature review synthesizes available public sources on AI security, prompt injection, and mitigation strategies. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of this field, some specific frameworks mentioned in the request (such as OWASP LLM Top-10 2025) may not yet be publicly available. The review prioritizes peer-reviewed academic sources, authoritative industry guidance, and publicly available security frameworks.

**Limitations**: 
- Some proprietary security solutions and internal industry research may not be publicly accessible
- The field is rapidly evolving, with new attack vectors and mitigations being discovered regularly
- Cross-referencing between different security frameworks and standards is ongoing work

**Future Updates**: This review should be updated quarterly to incorporate new research findings, published standards, and evolving threat intelligence as the field matures.

## Research Gap & Goal

Despite extensive research into AI safety and prompt injection detection, current literature reveals a critical absence of **small, model-agnostic enforcement runtimes** that provide per-response cryptographic certificates for computation integrity. Existing solutions, while addressing detection capabilities through input filtering and output monitoring, fail to deliver lightweight, deterministic enforcement mechanisms that can operate across diverse AI model architectures. The OWASP AI Security and Privacy Guide emphasizes the need for "defense in depth" approaches, yet current implementations rely heavily on probabilistic detection rather than proof-carrying enforcement [@owasp_ai_guide2024].

Furthermore, the field lacks a **compact I²-Bench-Lite** (Indirect Injection Benchmark-Lite) that provides both adversarial test cases and their corresponding benign twins with gold-standard predicates for systematic evaluation. While NIST's AI Risk Management Framework calls for "measurable" and "repeatable" testing methodologies [@nist_ai_rmf2023], existing benchmarks are either proprietary, computationally expensive, or lack the semantic pairing necessary for precise false-positive rate assessment.

**Goal**: This research aims to define **Non-Interactive Universal Computing (NIUC)** as a framework for privacy-preserving computation with verifiable certificates. We will implement a tiny checker (≤500 LOC) and runtime gate that together provide deterministic security enforcement with cryptographic attestation for every approved computation. Additionally, we will release I²-Bench-Lite as an open benchmark suite enabling reproducible evaluation of indirect prompt injection defenses.

**Testable Hypotheses**: Our NIUC implementation will demonstrate: (1) Attack Success Rate (ASR) reduction to ≤10% against indirect prompt injection; (2) False Positive Rate (FPR) <2% on benign computational tasks; (3) Utility degradation (UtilityΔ) ≥ −3% compared to unprotected baselines; (4) Latency overhead ≤60ms per response; and (5) ≥10× cost reduction compared to frontier guard solutions on equivalent test suites. These metrics align with NIST's emphasis on balancing security effectiveness with operational practicality in AI system deployment.
