# Threat Model

## Overview
This document outlines the threat model for the PCC-NIUC system, identifying potential adversaries, attack vectors, and security assumptions.

## Security Assumptions

### Trusted Components
- Hardware security modules (HSMs)
- Cryptographic primitives
- Operating system kernel (with qualifications)

### Untrusted Components
- User-provided code
- Network communication
- External data sources

## Adversary Model

### Adversary Capabilities
- **Honest-but-Curious**: Follows protocol but tries to learn private information
- **Malicious**: May deviate from protocol arbitrarily
- **Adaptive**: Can adjust strategy based on observed behavior

### Attack Vectors

#### Code-level Attacks
- Malicious code injection
- Side-channel information leakage
- Timing attacks
- Memory access pattern analysis

#### System-level Attacks
- Runtime manipulation
- Certificate forgery
- Replay attacks
- Man-in-the-middle attacks

#### Cryptographic Attacks
- Key extraction attempts
- Protocol weakness exploitation
- Quantum computing threats

## Security Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Confidentiality**: Sensitive data remains private
2. **Integrity**: Computations produce correct results
3. **Authenticity**: Certificates are verifiably genuine
4. **Non-repudiation**: Actions cannot be denied

### Secondary Goals
- Performance efficiency
- Scalability
- Usability

## Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Controls
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure execution environments
- Cryptographic protection
- Audit logging

### Procedural Controls
- Security reviews
- Penetration testing
- Incident response procedures

## Residual Risks
- Hardware vulnerabilities
- Implementation bugs
- Cryptographic weaknesses
- Social engineering attacks
