 dont# Introduction

The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in production applications has fundamentally transformed how computational systems interact with users and external data sources. Modern LLM deployments integrate diverse information channels—including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from knowledge bases, tool outputs from APIs, conversation history, and user-uploaded content—to provide contextually rich and informed responses. However, this architectural complexity introduces critical security vulnerabilities that traditional cybersecurity approaches struggle to address effectively.

Among the most pressing threats is **indirect prompt injection**, where malicious actors embed imperatives within seemingly benign content to manipulate LLM behavior and trigger unauthorized actions. The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications identifies prompt injection as the primary security risk (LLM01:2025), noting that attackers can "cause the LLM to ignore previous instructions and perform actions intended by the attacker" through carefully crafted inputs embedded in external data sources [@owasp_llm_2025]. Unlike direct prompt injection, which targets user inputs, indirect attacks exploit the implicit trust that LLM applications place in retrieved documents, API responses, and historical conversations.

Current research demonstrates sophisticated evasion techniques that exploit Unicode complexity, multilingual text processing, and contextual ambiguity. Attackers leverage homoglyph substitution (using Cyrillic 'а' instead of Latin 'a'), zero-width character injection to hide imperatives, code fence execution markers, false authority citations, and multi-turn conversation poisoning to bypass existing security measures. These attacks have proven particularly effective because they exploit fundamental assumptions about content trust and channel integrity in modern LLM architectures.

Existing mitigation strategies predominantly rely on **detection-based approaches** that attempt to identify malicious content through input validation, output filtering, and behavioral monitoring. Policy classifiers, content filters, and safety guardrails operate as probabilistic systems that analyze input patterns and assign risk scores. However, these approaches suffer from fundamental limitations that create exploitable gaps in security coverage. First, detection systems operate **post-hoc**, analyzing content after it has been processed by the LLM, rather than preventing malicious inputs from reaching the model in the first place. Second, probabilistic classifiers inevitably produce false positives and false negatives, creating either usability degradation or security vulnerabilities. Third, existing systems lack **mathematical guarantees** about their security properties, making it impossible to provide formal assurance that malicious content will be consistently blocked.

The detection-versus-enforcement gap becomes particularly problematic in privacy-preserving computation contexts, where multiple organizations or administrative domains must collaborate while maintaining strict trust boundaries. Traditional approaches cannot provide cryptographic proof that a computation has been verified against security policies, nor can they guarantee that approved operations maintain their security properties throughout complex processing pipelines. This limitation fundamentally undermines the trust composition necessary for distributed privacy-preserving systems.

Recent advances in **Proof-Carrying Code (PCC)** [@necula_lee_1996] suggest an alternative paradigm where computational units include mathematical proofs of their safety properties, enabling recipients to verify security without trusting the producer. However, existing PCC approaches have not been adapted to address the specific challenges of LLM security, particularly the need for real-time processing, Unicode attack resistance, and per-response certification of indirect prompt injection resistance.

## Our Approach

We introduce **Non-Interactive Universal Computing (NIUC)**, a novel framework that replaces probabilistic detection with **deterministic enforcement** and cryptographic attestation. NIUC provides mathematical guarantees that no imperative command originating from untrusted content channels can reach side-effectful operations, regardless of evasion techniques employed. Our approach shifts the security paradigm from "detect and hope" to "verify and prove," enabling trustworthy composition of LLM applications across organizational boundaries.

The NIUC framework enforces a fundamental security property through **character-level provenance tracking**: every character in processed input maintains attribution to its originating trust channel (trusted or untrusted), and any imperative command that overlaps with untrusted characters triggers a security violation. This approach provides resilience against Unicode-based evasion techniques while maintaining deterministic behavior essential for cryptographic verification.

Our implementation consists of three architectural components working in concert. A **deterministic checker** (224 lines of code) performs Unicode normalization, imperative detection, and NIUC property verification without relying on machine learning or external dependencies, ensuring auditability and reproducible behavior. A **runtime gate** provides two enforcement modes: strict blocking for high-security environments and certified-rewrite for utility preservation, where untrusted imperatives are neutralized through annotation and the resulting text is re-verified for safety. Finally, **cryptographic certificates** provide mathematical attestation that approved computations satisfy the NIUC property, enabling trust composition across system boundaries.

To enable systematic evaluation and comparison with existing approaches, we developed **Hydra-Bench-500**, a comprehensive indirect prompt injection benchmark comprising 500 scenarios across 17 attack categories: HTML attribute injection, tool output manipulation, code fence execution markers, citation authority abuse, multilingual evasion, conversation context poisoning, steganographic encoding, template injection, social engineering, privilege escalation, path traversal attacks, command chaining, nested code confusion, advanced Unicode evasion, advanced citation abuse, context poisoning, and time-based attacks. Each attack scenario includes systematically paired benign twins, enabling precise measurement of false positive rates while maintaining comprehensive attack coverage.

## Contributions

Our work makes the following contributions to LLM security and privacy-preserving computation:

• **Formal NIUC Framework**: We provide the first mathematical formalization of security properties for LLM applications processing mixed trusted/untrusted content, including formal specifications, threat models, and certificate schemas that enable cryptographic verification of indirect prompt injection resistance.

• **Production-Ready Implementation**: We develop a complete system comprising a deterministic ≤500 LOC checker, dual-mode runtime gate with certified-rewrite capability, and model-agnostic architecture supporting both local and API model deployments, achieving 0.0% false positive rate with 0.2ms processing latency.

• **Hydra-Bench-500 Benchmark**: We release the most comprehensive standardized benchmark for indirect prompt injection evaluation, featuring 500 scenarios with attack/benign twin pairs across 17 categories and automated evaluation harness, providing unprecedented statistical power for robust comparative studies and establishing performance baselines for future research.
